# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Coded an animated calendar for #dailycssimages on codepen. Started reading about Big O notations on Interview Cake.

**Thoughts:** Had an initial idea of making a 12 months calendar by using .clone method in JS. Ended up making 2 months and will return to it because it needs 12 css illustrations hahah. Also, Big O notation what?..

### Day 2: January 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Another css animation done. Created Cheburashka (soviet union animated animal) in pure CSS.

**Thoughts:** Spent probably 3 hours. Would love to use more SASS than CSS to avoid code repetition.

### Day 3: January 21, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Feeling sick, but still managed to watch a bunch of Javascript tutorials from thenewboston on youtube. Great stuff.

**Thoughts:** I wish I was good with JS just like I am with CSS )) Practice makes perfect though..

### Day 4: January 23, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Today is a great day! I finished day 11 of #dailycssimages challenge. And notice my pen in The weekly Codepen Spark, which is such a motivation to me.

**Thoughts:** Feeling good.

### Day 5: January 27, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Everyday I'm CSS'ing... Background gradients are so powerful.  And autoprefix generator took all the worries for adding prefixes away :) 

**Thoughts:** Was not really in a code mood today but still got this burger animation going.

### Day 6: January 29, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started Javascript30 course. Made an interactive piano with vanilla js. Still in progress for enhancements.

**Thoughts:** Gotta do more javascript...

### Day 7: January 30, 2017

**Today's Progress**: #dailycss images challenge continues. Created Franketnstein animation.

**Thoughts:** Was really struggling with z-index when it comes to children to parent elements with pseudo-elements. Made good use of background linear-gradient.
