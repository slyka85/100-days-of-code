# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Coded an animated calendar for #dailycssimages on codepen. Started reading about Big O notations on Interview Cake.

**Thoughts:** Had an initial idea of making a 12 months calendar by using .clone method in JS. Ended up making 2 months and will return to it because it needs 12 css illustrations hahah. Also, Big O notation what?..

### Day 2: January 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Another css animation done. Created Cheburashka (soviet union animated animal) in pure CSS.

**Thoughts:** Spent probably 3 hours. Would love to use more SASS than CSS to avoid code repetition.
